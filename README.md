# ZÃ¼ri Crypto Cars NFT DApp

ZÃ¼ri Crypto Cars NFT DApp is a decentralized application built on the Ethereum blockchain that allows car enthusiasts to buy and sell unique, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) representing cars (in particular my own one ðŸ˜Š)

## How it Works
Users can browse and purchase NFTs representing a range of cars, from vintage classics to modern supercars. Each NFT is a unique digital asset that represents ownership of a specific car.

Using the ZÃ¼ri Crypto Cars NFT DApp, car owners can tokenize their vehicles and sell them as NFTs, allowing others to invest in and own a piece of their favorite cars.

The ZÃ¼ri Crypto Cars NFT DApp uses smart contracts to ensure secure and transparent transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. All transactions are recorded on the blockchain, providing a permanent and immutable record of ownership and transfer.

## Getting Started
To get started with ZÃ¼ri Crypto Cars NFT DApp, you will need an Ethereum wallet and some Ether (ETH) to purchase NFTs.
