Züri Crypto Cars NFT DApp is Ethereum market place, connecting buyer and sellers of cars.
Its cool because it comes with a escrow and helps with the paperwork.

## Motivation
I came up with the ideas, since I was selling my own car and most requests I got was for export. 
People wanted to pay in cash and ideally no in CHF. I was worried about getting counterfeid 

## How it Works
Users can browse and purchase NFTs representing a range of cars. Each NFT is a unique digital asset that represents ownership of a specific car.

Using the Züri Crypto Cars NFT DApp, car owners can tokenize their vehicles and sell them as NFTs, allowing others to invest in and own a piece of their favorite cars.
